<h3 id="five-favorite-tasks">Five Favorite tasks</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case</p>

    <p>When I’m learning how to use a new technology or searching for programming inspiration, I often look to online tutorials for a baseline of how to use, and what kind of things that technology is good for building. Video tutorials make this kind of learning more accessible than a simple blog post might, if done well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debug a customer’s build using a programming language and framework that you’ve never seen before</p>

    <p>I have experience with Javascript, Ruby, and Python, but I also have interest in other programming languages and concepts that I know I’ve only been able to scratch the surface of. Being able to work in a new programming language is often an enjoyable treat and I feel I have the flexibility to work in strongly typed or functional programming languages such as C#, Java, or Elixir.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.</p>

    <p>Documentation is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure for a company. Good docs not only make a technology more accessible, they also improve the likelihood of people sharing a technology with their friends or colleagues.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product</p>

    <p>Analyzing large amounts of information can be daunting for many, but I appreciate the opportunity to improve a product on a large scale. It makes sense that if there are hundreds or thousands of customers with the same or similar issue, a new approach or solution might fix many of these issues at once. When I see issues like these as a programmer, my instinct is always to fix the larger issue, rather than solving many individual problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub</p>

    <p>I’ve always liked squashing bugs and solving edge cases. This often requires a deep dive into what is causing the bug, and submitting a pull request for a bug is always a great feeling!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="five-least-favorite-tasks">Five Least Favorite Tasks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day</p>

    <p>This sounds painful! While I consider myself solid at multitasking, I prefer to focus on one or several issues per day. On the other hand, if the focus of this task is more for quicker issues or directing larger issues to other staff, I could see myself keeping up with this task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find and recruit teammates for the support team</p>

    <p>I’m not much of a recruiter - a big part of which is selling yourself and the company to someone who likely already has a job they like, and I’ve never been a great salesperson.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manage a support team</p>

    <p>I’m also not much of a manager. I know I’d be fine with onboarding new teammates or helping others with an issue they’re having, but it would take me at least a year or two working at Netlify to be comfortable managing others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model</p>

    <p>It’s already explained on your website, so it feels like self-explanatory. On the one hand, I feel like I’d be great at explaining pricing levels and features included, but on the other hand I feel like I would be responsible for selling potential customers on services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers</p>

    <p>Although I’d feel comfortable with this after a while, I’d be nervous about talking on the phone with mission critical clients in my first few months. For me, experience === comfort.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

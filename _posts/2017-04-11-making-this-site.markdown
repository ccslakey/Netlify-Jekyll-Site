This static site was made with [jekyll][jekyll-site] - a simple static site generator based on Ruby. Because of my experience with Ruby, I chose Jekyll over other similar generators such as Hugo or Hexo, which are Go and Javascript based, respectively. I chose Jekyll over Octopress because Octopress hasn't seen any updates in a year or two. Although Gitbooks is my favorite static site generator, I decided not to use it because I feel like it fits a use case of documentation, whereas I wanted to have more of a blogging feel with these Q&A's. One challenge I had initiall was silencing all the Gemfile errors and getting set up with my Ruby version. Beyond that and SSL setup, it's been smooth sailing with Jekyll and Netlify!

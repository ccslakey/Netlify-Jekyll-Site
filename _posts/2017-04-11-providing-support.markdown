My favorite aspect of providing technical support is difficult to decide on. On the one hand, I enjoy making someone's day easier by providing them with a fix. I also greatly enjoy the process of bug-fixing, which often involves speaking with the client to understand the issue, and then digging through code to track logic and find where the issue resides. My favorite aspect is probably the understanding that goes into the actual fix, and the "journey", so to speak that one takes to resolve an issue.

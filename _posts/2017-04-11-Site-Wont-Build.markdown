Without much information, there's not a lot I can do for a client with this little information, so I would first ask for some info, i.e.:

* What static site generator/framework are you using?
* Is there an error or screenshot I can see?
* Does the site work locally?
* When you say it doesn't build, is that on trying to deploy to Netlify or on your local machine? If it's during Netlify deploy, please share the logs.

Secondly, I would try to provide whatever general information is usually given/asked for to provide a more useful response on both mine and the customer's side.

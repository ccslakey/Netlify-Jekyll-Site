SSL is important to me for several reasons:

* SSL ensures that my personal information is encrypted as it travels across the internet
* Seeing an SSL certificate on a site lets me know that I can trust it with my information.
* Without SSL, any computer/server my information passes through can see my unencrypted information. Credit cards, login info, and more can all be accessed. Yikes!
